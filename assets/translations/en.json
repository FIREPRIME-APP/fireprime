        "description": "Combustible façade elements (e.g., timber, vinyl) are vulnerable to all types of wildfire ignitions. Even firebrands or low-intensity flames may ignite a timber or vinyl façade element, while bricks and concrete elements resist much better to fire. Wooden porches entail a large horizontal surface on which firebrands (burning particles that come from the fire) may land. Their close contact with the garden floor also makes them vulnerable to direct flame contact.",

        "description": "When the roof covering presents gaps, the structure laying underneath is then exposed to the fire. The fire can also enter through unsealed spaces between the roof and external walls. The cleaning from debris of the roof and gutters is key to avoid ignition of fuels that may pile up (e.g., dried pine needles).",

        "description": "Windows and glass doors are frequently one of the most exposed elements to fire. Broken glazing systems are entry points for firebrands and heat, which can potentially trigger ignition of fuels inside the house. Single pane glazing systems resist less to fire and heat exposure compared to double or multiple pane systems or tempered glass.

        "description": "If windows are protected by shutters, then the heat received by the glass is reduced, increasing the chances that the glass will not break. Wood and PVC shutters are combustible and could ignite or melt (in case of PVC). Aluminium and fire-rated (e.g., steel) shutters have proven to resist well to wildfire exposure. To block the heat coming from the fire, shutters and shutter slats should be completely closed.",

        "description": "Semi-confined spaces are areas that are partially open, such as those located under terraces, porches, decks, eaves or canopies, or the spaces enclosed in open sheds. The presence of combustible materials in such spaces entails large heat accumulation, should these materials be ignited, leading potentially to structural damage of the envelope of the semi-confined space.",

Non-combustible materials such as aluminium or steel are more resistant, but could still melt or lose strength when exposed to a large enough heat dose. Non-combustible materials such as bricks or concrete are the most resistant to the effects of fire.",

        "description": "When an above ground domestic Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) tank is exposed to the heat coming from a fire, the tank will heat up and pressurize. If the tank pressure reaches the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) set point, this will open, releasing LPG that will immediately ignite forming a jet fire, which will worsen the heat load to the tank and its surroundings. In the worst case it may evolve into an explosion and the ignition of surrounding objects. It is therefore best to not have any combustible fuels located within 2 m from the tank.",
