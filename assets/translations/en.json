        "description": "Combustible façade elements (e.g., timber, vinyl) are vulnerable to all types of wildfire ignitions. Even firebrands or low-intensity flames may ignite a timber or vinyl façade element, while bricks and concrete elements resist much better to fire. Wooden porches entail a large horizontal surface on which firebrands (burning particles that come from the fire) may land. Their close contact with the garden floor also makes them vulnerable to direct flame contact.",

        "description": "Having a non-combustible foundation can prevent envelope ignition in cases when very low flames (e.g., fire spreading through the grass lawn) impinge onto the envelope. The higher the non-combustible foundation, the less likely it is that flames coming from surface fuels will cause ignition of the elements of the combustible envelope.",

        "description": "When the roof covering presents gaps, the structure laying underneath is then exposed to the fire. The fire can also enter through unsealed spaces between the roof and external walls. The cleaning from debris of the roof and gutters is key to avoid ignition of fuels that may pile up (e.g., dried pine needles).",

        "question": "What is the type of glazing of windows and glass doors?",
        "description": "Windows and glass doors are frequently one of the most exposed elements to fire. Broken glazing systems are entry points for firebrands and heat, which can potentially trigger ignition of fuels inside the house. Single pane glazing systems resist less to fire and heat exposure compared to double or multiple pane systems or tempered glass. If your building presents more than one type of glazing systems, select the most representative option.",

Wood and PVC shutters are combustible and could ignite or melt (in case of PVC). Aluminium and fire-rated (e.g., steel) shutters have proven to resist well to wildfire exposure. To block the heat coming from the fire, shutters and shutter slats should be completely closed.",

Typical types of vents found in houses are roof openings for attic ventilation (e.g. vent tiles, ridge closer vents), chimneys, and openings for the ventilation of kitchens. Vents should be screened with corrosion-resistant, non-combustible wire meshes (e.g. aluminium, galvanized steel, stainless steel, copper, intumescent coating), with a characteristic length small enough to prevent the pass of firebrands (< 2mm).",

        "question": "Is there a semi-confined space adjacent to your house (i.e., it has at least one wall in common with the house) that contains combustible materials?",
        "description": "Semi-confined spaces are areas that are partially open, such as those located under terraces, porches, decks, eaves or canopies, or the spaces enclosed in open sheds. The presence of combustible materials in such spaces entails large heat accumulation, should these materials be ignited, leading potentially to structural damage of the envelope of the semi-confined space.",

        "description": "Unprotected glazing systems are a very weak element when it comes to fire resistance. If the elements inside the semi-confined space are ignited, the glass could break and allow fire entrance inside the building.",

        "description": "Combustible envelope materials are the weakest to fire, as they can ignite and cause fire spread along the envelope and towards the inside of the building. Non-combustible materials such as aluminium or steel are more resistant, but could still melt or lose strength when exposed to a large enough heat dose. Non-combustible materials such as bricks or concrete are the most resistant to the effects of fire.",

Wooden porches and decks should be also considered in this question, as they entail a large horizontal surface on which firebrands (burning particles that come from the fire) may land.

        "description": "When an above ground domestic Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) tank is exposed to the heat coming from a fire, the tank will heat up and pressurize. If the tank pressure reaches the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) set point, this will open, releasing LPG that will immediately ignite forming a jet fire, which will worsen the heat load to the tank and its surroundings. In the worst case it may evolve into an explosion and the ignition of surrounding objects. It is therefore best to not have any combustible fuels located within 2 m from the tank.",
